1.	Lucy Taylor lntaylor3@my.waketech.edu
2.	This is my first experience using GitHub. At the time of this lab my GitHub account is empty. Excited to dive deeper and create some cool things. 
3.	The repository I created is named by the username I chose for my GitHub account, and currently only includes this README file. I have downloaded Visual Studio code and am using that to edit this file. 
4.	Downloaded the desktop client, used the 'clone repository' and chose the folder on my local computer that I wanted the repository to be in.
